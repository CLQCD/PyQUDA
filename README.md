# PyQuda

Python wrapper for [QUDA](https://github.com/lattice/quda) written in Cython.

This project aims to benifit from the optimized linear algebra library [CuPy](https://github.com/cupy/cupy) in Python based on CUDA. CuPy and QUDA will allow us to do most operation in lattice QCD research with high performance.

This project is based on the latest QUDA release v1.1.0.

You need to build `libquda.so` as the prerequisite.

## Installation

### QUDA

This is an example to build QUDA for single GPU. The default install directory of QUDA should be `/path/to/quda/build/usqcd`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lattice/quda.git
pushd quda
git checkout develop
mkdir build
pushd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE -DQUDA_CLOVER_DYNAMIC=OFF -DQUDA_CLOVER_RECONSTRUCT=OFF -DQUDA_DIRAC_DOMAIN_WALL=OFF -DQUDA_DIRAC_NDEG_TWISTED_CLOVER=OFF -DQUDA_DIRAC_NDEG_TWISTED_MASS=OFF -DQUDA_DIRAC_TWISTED_CLOVER=OFF -DQUDA_DIRAC_TWISTED_MASS=OFF -DQUDA_LAPLACE=ON -DQUDA_MULTIGRID=ON -DQUDA_MPI=ON -DQUDA_LAPLACE=ON
cmake --build . -j12
cmake --install .
popd
popd
```

### PyQuda

Install PyQuda with your Python interpreter.
Here we set `QUDA_PATH` to the install directory of QUDA. A `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` containing `libquda.so` is also allowed.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CLQCD/PyQuda.git
cd PyQuda
export QUDA_PATH=../quda/build/usqcd
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m pip install .
```

Chroma is needed here for generating the reference files used by test scripts.
A precompiled Chroma is included in the repository, and you need to fetch it with git-lfs.

```bash
git lfs pull
```

The reference files used by test scripts should be generated by running Chroma with `test.*.ini.xml`.

```bash
tests/bin/chroma -i tests/test.clover.ini.xml
python3 tests/test.clover.py
```

Or just run the Python script that automatically calls Chroma.

```bash
python3 tests/test.clover.chroma.py
```

## Development

I recommand you to build PyQuda using inplace mode instead of installing PyQuda.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CLQCD/PyQuda.git
cd PyQuda
export QUDA_PATH=../quda/build/usqcd
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace
```

Now you can modify Python files in the project and immediately get the result by running scripts. Adding the root directory to `sys.path` list is needed if you are running scripts from other directories.
